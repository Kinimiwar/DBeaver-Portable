> **When you need something but you can't find it... _JUST CREATE IT_** :shipit:

## :large_orange_diamond: Description  
This is just a simple package that can run a portable version of DBeaver.
The package doesn't include the JRE due to download-license issue. You need to manually download and extract it. More information inside the Readme file.

## :large_orange_diamond: Features  
- It is basically DBeaver!
- "Install" on your USB and bring dbeaver with you everywhere!
- Project and Drivers are stored inside "Data" folder!
- Temporary file association! (.sql)

## :large_orange_diamond: Issues: auto-update & manual jre download :warning:  
I tried to implement an auto-update (and auto jre download) system for this portable edition but I stopped the project due to some issues: it requires 3rd-party library and a .net framework installed. 
These issues are caused by me because I code in C#... so I don't know what to do.
Should I implement it anyway? Let me know your opinions using github's issues!
